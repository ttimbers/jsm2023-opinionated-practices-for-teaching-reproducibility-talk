# Data Science:

### *the study, development and practice* 
### *of reproducible and auditable processes* 
### *to obtain insight from data*

---

class: middle

## Reproducible analysis:

#### *reaching the same result given the same input, computational methods and conditions*<sup>1</sup>.

## Transparent analysis,

#### *a readable record of the steps used to carry out the analysis as well as a record of how the analysis methods evolved*.<sup>2</sup>

## Why do we adopt this definition?

We believe that data science work should both bring insight 
and employ reproducible and auditable methods so that
trustworthy results and data products can be created.

Data products can be built via other methods, 
but we lack confidence in how the results or
products were created.

We believe this stems from non-reproducible and
non-auditable analyses:

1. lacking evidence that the results or product could be regenerated given
the same input computational methods, and conditions

2. lacking evidence of the steps taken during creation

3. having an incomplete record of how and why analysis decisions were
made

## Examples of things that can go wrong without reproducible practices

- An interesting result that you cannot recreate üòû

- Your email inbox is full of information related to the project that only you have access too üò´

- A small change to the analysis code requires re-running the entire thing, *and takes hours...* üòß

- Activation time to becoming productive after taking a break from the project is hours to days üò¥

- Code that can only be run on one machine, *and you don't know why...* üòµ

## *So if reproducibility is so important for data science, why is it hard to teach it?*

---

class: middle

## Possibilities:

1. Lack of awareness of the problem?

2. Reproducibility is an inconvenient means to end, rather than an important skill?

3. Reproducibility does not directly lead to novel insights?

## Key things for teaching reproducibility

### 1. placing extra emphasis on motivation

### 2. guided instruction

### 3. lots of practice!!!
